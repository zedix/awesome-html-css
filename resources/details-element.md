# The `<details>` element

The HTML `details` element represents a disclosure widget. It can also be used as a part of an `accordion` widget.
The user experience more consistent, and generally better, in a number of areas:
- keyboard shortcuts and focus handling,
- exposure via ARIA to assistive technology, and
- integration with browser features such as find-in-page.

Exclusive Accordion:

```html
<details name="my-accordion">
  <summary>Summary 1</summary>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
</details>

<details name="my-accordion" open>
  <summary>Summary 2</summary>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
</details>
```

The `<details>` elements that are part of an exclusive accordion don't necessarily need to be siblings. They can be scattered across the document.
